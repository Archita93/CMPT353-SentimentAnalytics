      "Always adept at getting the attention of right-leaning news media in the U.S., the Kremlin appears to be reviving a conspiracy theory promoted by Donald Trump ahead of the 2020 election about the Biden family carrying out nefarious deeds at Burisma just in time for the 2024 vote.\n",

      "The Ukrainian energy company, where the younger Biden previously served on the board, has long been at the center of claims made by Trump’s allies in the GOP that both Hunter and Joe Biden were part of a massive international bribery scheme.\n",

      "Spring has sprung (from a very strange winter) here in cheese-land so time to write is going to be scarce again. This also means lots of solar and wind energy generation in the western half of the USA. I’m a bit late but we set a record of two days where our number two source of electricity was wind generation! The chart is shown below for daily production and wind is second for March 24 and 25, just above nuclear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below is the hourly chart showing that wind was above nuclear for most of the 48 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the details for those two days.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not because nuclear was at some low point or any other freak event. Nuclear power is very constant throughout the year while other sources vary as available or as needed. The 31 day hourly chart shows wind energy pushing at the nuclear line several times. On March 25 wind energy came unusually close to the natural gas generation and this means that wind might become the number one source, for just a few hours, sometime in April or May.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point to keep in mind is that this wind energy is mostly west of the Mississippi river so, although we are looking at national numbers, this is really regional (not that there’s anything wrong with that, just some perspective).\n",
      "\n",
      "Also notable is how much of the 31 days shows wind as the number three generator and coal as number four, which gives us low emissions electricity. The green energy transition marches on and, since we cannot loose four years of progress, vote blue to keep it moving forward.\n",
      "U.S. stock index futures were flat Tuesday, as investors refrained from placing large bets ahead of a crucial inflation reading later in the week that could influence the Federal Reserve's stance on rate cuts this year.\n",

      "Traders see a nearly 51% chance of an at-least 25 bps cut in June, according to the CME's FedWatch Tool, down from 64% last week.\n",
